# Gumline-Extraction

This is an implementation of paper with minor changes to get better results: ***Tooth segmentation on dental meshes using morphologic skeleton***

My codes are written based on the rtsc-1.5 source code, I use their code for curvature computing.

You can put your tooth models under ```/trimesh_framework/models/```, the model type should be obj.
